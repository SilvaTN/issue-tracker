I am developing an issue tracker.
Right now it has nothing but eventually it will have features like:
    You can demo it, but any input data will not be stored.
    You can create an account and sign in, which will allow you to use this web application to its fullest potential and will solve literally all problems you have in your life, as long as the problems you have are all related to needing an issue tracker.
    It will rid the world of all its problems, assuming that they are all related to, again, needing an issue tracker, which I'm pretty sure they all are.
